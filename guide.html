    <h1>Home Buying Guide</h1>
    <p>Buying a home is one of the biggest decisions you will make. This guide walks you through every step so you can approach the process with confidence.</p>
    <p class="meta" style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px;">Last updated: February 2026</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-content">
    <h2>Step 1: Assess Your Financial Readiness</h2>
    <p>Before you start browsing listings, take a clear-eyed look at your finances. Buying a home involves more than the purchase price — there are closing costs, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and potential HOA fees to consider.</p>
    <h3>Key Financial Benchmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Conventional loans typically require 5-20% down. FHA loans may accept as little as 3.5% with mortgage insurance.</li>
      <li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Most lenders prefer your total monthly debt payments (including the future mortgage) to be below 43% of your gross monthly income.</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency fund:</strong> Aim to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved beyond your down payment. Unexpected repairs are a reality of homeownership.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit score:</strong> A score of 620 or above is typically needed for conventional loans. Higher scores unlock better interest rates, which can save tens of thousands over the life of a loan.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use online mortgage calculators to estimate your monthly payment at different price points. This will give you a realistic sense of what you can comfortably afford.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage</h2>
    <p>Pre-approval is different from pre-qualification. Pre-qualification is a rough estimate; pre-approval involves a lender reviewing your income, assets, credit history, and employment to issue a conditional commitment for a specific loan amount.</p>
    <h3>Why Pre-Approval Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It tells you exactly how much you can borrow, so you search in the right price range.</li>
      <li>Sellers take pre-approved buyers more seriously. In competitive markets like Seattle and Bellevue, a pre-approval letter can make or break your offer.</li>
      <li>It identifies potential issues (credit problems, documentation gaps) early, giving you time to resolve them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common Mortgage Types</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fixed-rate (30-year):</strong> The most popular option. Your interest rate and monthly payment stay the same for the entire loan term. Provides predictability.</li>
      <li><strong>Fixed-rate (15-year):</strong> Higher monthly payments but significantly less interest paid over the life of the loan. Good if you can afford the payment.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjustable-rate (ARM):</strong> Lower initial rate that adjusts after a set period (e.g., 5/1 ARM adjusts after 5 years). Can be risky if rates rise, but useful if you plan to move within a few years.</li>
      <li><strong>FHA loans:</strong> Government-backed loans with lower down payment requirements. Good for first-time buyers but require mortgage insurance premiums.</li>
      <li><strong>VA loans:</strong> Available to eligible veterans and active military. Offer zero down payment and no mortgage insurance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Define Your Priorities</h2>
    <p>Not every home will check every box. Before you start touring properties, make a list of must-haves versus nice-to-haves. This prevents emotional decision-making later.</p>
    <h3>Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What neighborhoods fit your commute, lifestyle, and budget?</li>
      <li>How many bedrooms and bathrooms does your household need?</li>
      <li>Is a yard important, or do you prefer low-maintenance living (condo, townhome)?</li>
      <li>Are you willing to renovate, or do you need move-in ready?</li>
      <li>How important are school districts, walkability, or transit access?</li>
      <li>What is your timeline? Do you need to move by a specific date?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Write these down and share them with your realtor. A clear brief saves time and helps your agent focus on properties that truly match.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Find the Right Real Estate Agent</h2>
    <p>A good buyer's agent is your advocate throughout the entire process. They will help you find properties, schedule tours, negotiate offers, navigate inspections, and close the deal.</p>
    <h3>What to Look For</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local expertise:</strong> An agent who knows the neighborhoods you are targeting can provide insights that online listings cannot — school quality, future development plans, flood zones, noise levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication style:</strong> Choose someone who communicates the way you prefer (text, email, phone) and responds in a timely manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Track record:</strong> Ask about recent transactions in your target area. An experienced agent will have navigated competitive offers, inspections, and negotiations many times.</li>
      <li><strong>No pressure:</strong> The right agent helps you make informed decisions, not rushed ones. If you feel pushed, look elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 5: Search and Tour Homes</h2>
    <p>This is the exciting part. Use HomeFind's search tools to filter by location, price, size, property type, and open house availability. Save your favorites so you can compare them side-by-side.</p>
    <h3>Tips for House Hunting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visit at different times:</strong> A neighborhood can feel very different on a weekday morning versus a Friday evening. Visit at multiple times to get the full picture.</li>
      <li><strong>Look beyond staging:</strong> Furniture and decor can be distracting. Focus on the layout, natural light, storage, and structural condition.</li>
      <li><strong>Check the basics:</strong> Run the faucets, open and close doors, look at the roof, check the water heater age. Small issues can signal larger problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Take notes and photos:</strong> After a few tours, homes start to blur together. Document what you liked and disliked about each one.</li>
      <li><strong>Research the area:</strong> Check crime statistics, school ratings, planned construction, and proximity to your daily needs (grocery stores, transit, parks).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 6: Make an Offer</h2>
    <p>When you find the right home, your agent will help you craft a competitive offer. The offer includes the price, contingencies (inspection, financing, appraisal), earnest money deposit, and your proposed closing timeline.</p>
    <h3>Offer Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your agent will pull comparable sales ("comps") to help you determine a fair offer price based on recent nearby transactions.</li>
      <li>In a seller's market, you may need to offer at or above asking price. In a buyer's market, there is more room to negotiate.</li>
      <li>Earnest money (typically 1-3% of the offer price) shows the seller you are serious. It goes toward your down payment at closing.</li>
      <li>Contingencies protect you. An inspection contingency lets you back out if the home has major issues. A financing contingency protects you if your loan falls through.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 7: Home Inspection</h2>
    <p>Never skip the home inspection. A licensed inspector will evaluate the home's structure, roof, plumbing, electrical systems, HVAC, foundation, and more. This typically costs $300-$500 and takes 2-4 hours.</p>
    <h3>What Inspectors Check</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Roof condition and estimated remaining life</li>
      <li>Foundation and structural integrity</li>
      <li>Plumbing (pipes, water heater, water pressure)</li>
      <li>Electrical (panel, wiring, outlets, GFCI protection)</li>
      <li>HVAC system age and condition</li>
      <li>Windows, doors, and insulation</li>
      <li>Signs of water damage, mold, or pest infestation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the inspection, your agent can negotiate repairs or a price reduction with the seller. Some issues are cosmetic; others are deal-breakers. Your inspector and agent will help you distinguish between the two.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Closing the Deal</h2>
    <p>Closing is the final step. You will sign a stack of documents, pay your closing costs, and receive the keys. The process typically takes 30-45 days from when your offer is accepted.</p>
    <h3>What to Expect at Closing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Final walkthrough:</strong> Visit the property one last time to confirm the seller has made agreed-upon repairs and the home is in the expected condition.</li>
      <li><strong>Closing costs:</strong> Typically 2-5% of the purchase price. These include lender fees, title insurance, escrow fees, property taxes, and prepaid insurance.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> You will sign the mortgage note, deed of trust, closing disclosure, and other legal documents. Review the closing disclosure at least three days before closing — it details every cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Funding:</strong> Your lender transfers the funds, the title transfers to you, and the deal is officially done.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>After You Move In</h2>
    <p>Congratulations — you are a homeowner! Here are a few things to take care of in the first few weeks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the locks and update security codes.</li>
      <li>Set up utilities (water, electricity, gas, internet) if not already transferred.</li>
      <li>Locate the main water shut-off valve and circuit breaker panel.</li>
      <li>Create a home maintenance schedule (HVAC filter changes, gutter cleaning, etc.).</li>
      <li>Keep all closing documents and your home inspection report in a safe place.</li>
      <li>Get to know your neighbors — they are your best resource for local tips.</li>
    </ul>
